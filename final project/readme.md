The goal of my final project/website is to create a space where I can present my paintings (favorite collection) of the school year. I want the paintings to be showcased and have information about them, this could potentially lead to a website about all the works ive done and if I ever get to the point of selling them, this would be a great base. My webiste will include a homepage with some information about me and my art, a second page showcasing the first piece in the collection, a third page featuring the second piece in the collection, and a final page showcasing the last piece. Each page will have the piece featured very large along with description about the piece. I hope to wow with color and design for this project as I struggle with html features. Im going to use everything weve learned so far to try and combine different elements to make an exciting and visually pleasing website. 

Responsive web design is important because you dont want your website to be overlooked by viewers and it can be if not easily accessible. Theres so many different platforms of technology so theres no saying what type of device users will view with and you want to be able to accomidate everyone. 

My testing sessions went okay but I was expecting some difficulty with usability because I am having some trouble with my drop-down menu. The layout is also a work in progress but my message was clear and the design is nice. 

Im having a lot of trouble with my drop down menu and centering items.
