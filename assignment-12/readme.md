The differences between padding, margin, and border are:
1. Padding is located inside the boarder and is the area between content and border.
2. Boarder is the perimter around your content and padding. A boarder is probably the most simple to understand and the one we most recognize. 
3. Lastly, margin is the outer layer around the boarder itself.
