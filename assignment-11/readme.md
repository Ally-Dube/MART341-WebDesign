Typography is the art and style behind text design. Typography is the differences between styles/fonts of text that give a unique feel or appereance. Its something that one can use to give their work a unique touch or make it stand out, it can also make a piece look more unified. 

The importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack is definitly underated. I didnt realize how nice it is to have an understanding of multiple fonts before this lesson because when you do, you can just pull from those and have different styles on hand. Searching for fonts is quite grueling so having some refrences makes things move along quicker. It may also make your work more unified. 

Web fonts are not technically safe fonts because they arent found on most devices and can vary in quality/appearance while web-safe fonts are installed as defaults for most computers and devices. A system font is different because its designed to be installed on a certain computer/system and is ready to use.
