I visted https://www.vogue.com/magazine in the year 2010. 

The older version has changed a lot when comparing the years 2010 and 2022, for instance, the web page is a lot shorter on the older version and contained a lot less content. It also has a dated design containing more sectioned out/blocky tabs to click on. The colors are red, white, and black where as in the new version its black and white, giving a more elegant and sleek look. The new magazine page has way more information and no longer has the top header tabs.
