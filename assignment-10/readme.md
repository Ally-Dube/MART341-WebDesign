The difference between class, id, universal, and element selectors show up when selecting properties to add attributes to. The element selector is probably the most basic and refers to elements based on element name. The id selector is unique to a page using a # symbol followed by the id name givin, different to that of the element selector it is more specific. The class selector is similar to the id selector because you give a name for a selection but class="name" is your input instead. Then you use a ."name" to select this element. With class selector, you can select specific elements like a < p > for example. Lastly, the univeral selector selects all elements on the page. You use this with the * symbol. This is different than all the other elements because it will affect the whole page. 


I went about choosing my color palette by basing it off a piece I created in painting class last year. Color has always ben an important factor in my paintings as they can really effect the emotion or energy of a piece. This paintings is one of my favorites due to the large color blocking and I thought it would be perfect for this assignment. I think I was right because I really love how my page turned out and I think the colors look great!
